Show a clock on secondary taskbar(s) in Windows 11

Windows 11 does not allow me to display a clock on the taskbar on secondary monitors. It is very important to me to be able to display a clock on other taskbars other than on the primary monitor. This is my attempt at re-implementing that feature.
